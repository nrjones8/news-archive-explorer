                    The screenshots used in this project are taken once an hour, across a number of websites, starting January 1, 2019.
                    You can find more information about the source of the screenshots, and how to use them for your own project, <a href="https://github.com/nrjones8/website-screenshotter#news-homepage-archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

                    This project is unaffiliated with <a href="http://www.pastpages.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PastPages</a>, a similar effort that took screenshots from 2012 to 2018 from a
                    much wider range of news websites.
